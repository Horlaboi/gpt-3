GPT-3: Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is an autoregressive language model released in 2020 that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. Given an initial text as prompt, it will produce text that continues the prompt.    GPT-3 model was trained by OpenAI company (Elon Mask is cofounder), and currently, you can only use it as paid REST API (which became available to anyone on Nov 18, 2021).

How it works: GPT-3 is a language prediction model. This means that it has a neural network machine learning model that can take input text and transform it into what it predicts the most useful result will be.
